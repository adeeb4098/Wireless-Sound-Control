# Wireless-Sound-Control
In this project for gesture
recognition, the human bodyâ€™s
motions are read by computer camera. The
computer then makes use of
this data as input to handle applications.
The objective of this project is to
develop an interface which will capture
human hand gesture dynamically
and will control the volume level.
